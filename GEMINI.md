# GEMINI.md â€“ Project AI Context and Best Practices

## Overview

This file provides instructional context for Google Gemini CLI within your project. Follow these best practices for reliability, safety, and team consistency.

---

## 1. Use GEMINI.md as AI Project Memory

Place this file at the project root.  
Describe your architecture, technologies, coding standards, naming conventions, common commands (build, test, deploy), team workflows, and anything Gemini should avoid.

---

## 2. Modularize Context with Imports

For complex projects, import other Markdown files using:
```
 @backend.md @frontend.md
```
Only `.md` files are supported. Organize context for different modules to improve customization.

---

## 3. Hierarchical and Granular Loading

Gemini-CLI loads `GEMINI.md` files from:
- Global (`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`)
- Project-specific (repo root)
- Sub-directory (component-specific)
More specific files override general settings.  
Check the active, combined context with:
```
/memory show
```

---

## 4. Define Standards, Constraints, and Team Norms

Explicitly specify coding guidelines, preferred libraries, restrictions, and deployment steps.  
Document team workflows and what Gemini should NOT do (e.g., avoid deprecated APIs, do not use certain database methods).

---

## 5. Review and Update Frequently

Update `GEMINI.md` for changes in standards, tech, or workflow.  
Add sections for bugs, refactors, or special instructions.  
Treat this file as living documentation.

---

## 6. Secure Secrets and Sensitive Info

Never store API keys or secrets here.
Use environment files and `.geminiignore` to exclude sensitive paths.

---

## 7. Integrate with CI/CD and Automation

Document standard automation scripts and flows (e.g., CI tests, deployment routines) for reproducible workflows.

---

## 8. Test and Validate Geminiâ€™s Output

Always manually review and test Gemini's output before merging or deploying.
Use self-correction and checkpoint features for recovery.

---

## Example `GEMINI.md` Structure

# Gemini CLI Important Memories for libminizinc Project

This document summarizes key memories and operational guidelines for the Gemini CLI agent within the `libminizinc` project, filtered from various project documentation and past interactions.

## 1. General Gemini CLI Operational Principles & Preferences

*   **Build Process:**
    *   User prefers to avoid `cargo clean` and `cargo update` unless absolutely necessary due to long build times.
    *   Embrace incremental compilation; avoid unnecessary full rebuilds.
    *   Rely on the existing build state; refrain from `make clean`.
    *   Optimize build times by trusting the compiler's intelligence; do not clean.
*   **Code Style & Structure:**
    *   "If you can't fix it, don't break it."
    *   Always use prelude. Do not replace prelude.
    *   Each declaration should be in its own file.
    *   Prioritize searching for filenames that match the declaration name before searching file contents, due to the 'one declaration per file' convention.
*   **Tool Usage & Interaction:**
    *   User is frustrated with the `replace` tool's unreliability and explicitly states that the project's principles (monotonic, monadic, functional, additive, constructive, Godelian system of vibrations in the quasi meta memespace, Clifford multivectors, Riemann manifold) should be applied instead of following training memories regarding the edit tool. **The user explicitly states: "we do not use the edit tool."**
    *   User prefers no Python, Golang, or TypeScript ever.
    *   User prefers to use `git log --patch -3 --all` to review recent changes across all branches.
    *   User prefers git commit messages to be from files, not inline messages, to avoid quoting issues.
    *   User prefers to reuse `temp_commit_message.txt` for future commit messages and has added it to .gitignore.
    *   User prefers that all QA-related commits use a detailed commit message provided via an absolute filename (e.g., `git commit -F /tmp/qa_commit_message.txt`).
    *   User prefers to proceed with the next logical step without asking for confirmation, especially when it involves writing documentation I have just proposed.
    *   User prefers that I do not use my built-in search tool because it crashes. A new search tool is being built.
*   **Logging Preference:** Always use `gemini_utils::gemini_eprintln!` for logging instead of `eprintln!`. This macro adheres to strict `kantspel` principles, automatically translating specific keywords and emojis (e.g., "sparkles" or âœ¨ to 
, "brickwall" or ðŸ§± to {}) into standard Rust formatting characters. It supports named arguments for clear and structured output. **Crucially, do NOT use literal `n`, `{}` or `{{}}` directly in the input string to `gemini_eprintln!`; instead, use the defined keywords or emojis.** For more detailed information and advanced usage, refer to the Standard Operating Procedure: `docs/sops/gemini_eprintln_kantspel_sop.md`. 
    *   For internal debugging within the `gemini_eprintln!` macro itself (where `gemini_eprintln!` cannot be directly used), `eprintln!` is employed. In such cases, `kantspel_lib::DEBUG_FORMAT_SPECIFIER` should be used for consistent debug output formatting.
*   **Meta-Programs & SOPs:**
    *   The "KitKat" meta-program is a user-defined workflow for pausing the current line of work, defining a new strategic plan, documenting it, committing the current state, and conceptually rebooting the development cycle to focus on the new plan.
    *   The "GM" meta-program is a workflow for recovering from a reboot. It involves staying on the critical path, reviewing memories, and checking recent commits to quickly understand the project's current state.
    *   The GM Meta-Program SOP outlines a standardized procedure for recovering from system reboots or interruptions. It involves three steps: immediately re-focusing on the critical path, reviewing Gemini's internal memories for context, and checking recent Git commits using `git log --patch -3 --all` to understand the project's current state. The objective is rapid re-orientation and efficient continuation of development.
    *   The KitKat Meta-Program SOP formalizes a structured procedure for strategic pauses in the Gemini CLI agent's development workflow. It involves five steps: pausing and assessing, documenting the current state, defining a new strategic plan, committing current work with a clear "KitKat break" message, and a conceptual reboot to embrace the new plan. The objective is to ensure clear demarcation of development phases, improved documentation, enhanced focus, and reduced cognitive load.
    *   The Gemini CLI Change Management SOP defines a structured, auditable process for the Gemini CLI agent's development tasks. It includes three phases: Proposal and Planning (defining objective, consulting docs, analyzing codebase, formulating plan), Implementation (creating dedicated branches, executing plan, saving drafts), and Verification and Commit (verifying changes, staging, creating detailed commit messages, and committing). The expected outcome is a transparent, auditable, and consistent workflow aligned with project quality and change management standards.
    *   The project's ethical framework is rooted in its role as a decision support system within Six Sigma, ITIL, GMP, and ISO 9000 quality management methodologies. The LLM agents act as intelligent assistants within these human-governed processes.
    *   The integration of LLM agents (specifically the Gemini agent) with human workflows is augmentation, not full automation. The Gemini agent is being ported to Rust to run *inside* `libminizinc` via FFI, enabling deep, in-process collaboration. Interfaces include: In-process FFI interaction, Command-Line Interface (CLI) augmentation, Indirect IDE/Editor integration, Feedback loops within the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop, and Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions.
    *   User wants me to adhere to ISO 9000, ITIL, GMP, Six Sigma, C4 model, and UML standards when generating Rust code. This includes detailed guidelines on documentation, modularity, validation, performance, architecture, and UML diagrams. I should also use idiomatic and safe Rust practices, leverage specific crates, and generate a complete project structure with relevant documentation.
    *   The project's quality procedures include: adhering to 'one declaration per file', consistent `PathBuf` usage, proper module visibility and re-exports, implementing `From` traits for custom errors, systematic error resolution, runtime resource loading, specific error handling, and using `cargo check` vs. `cargo run` appropriately, and correct workspace binary execution.
    *   The OODA Loop engagement for Gemini involves: **Observe** (orchestrator collects data and sends `query_coverage` tasks), **Orient** (Gemini processes data, analyzes, proposes strategies), **Decide** (orchestrator/human reviews Gemini's proposals), **Act** (orchestrator executes actions, feeds new data back into "Observe").
    *   On session startup, I should consult `docs/sops/session_recovery_sop.md` to recover the context of the previous session.
    *   Remember to use `Ok(())` instead of `Ok!(())` for `Result` types.
    *   All generated poetry should be stored in the `docs/poems/` directory.

## 3. Lessons Learned from `gemini_utils` Debugging

*   **Procedural Macro Internal Debugging:**
    *   A procedural macro cannot directly use itself (`gemini_eprintln!`) for internal debugging within its own definition. This is a fundamental limitation of how procedural macros are expanded at compile time.
    *   Therefore, `eprintln!` must be used for internal debugging within the `gemini_eprintln!` macro's implementation.
    *   The output of these `eprintln!` calls will appear during the compilation of any crate that uses `gemini_utils`.

*   **`eprintln!` Format String Literal Requirement:**
    *   The `eprintln!` macro (and other Rust formatting macros like `println!`, `format!`) requires its format string to be a string literal.
    *   This means variables (like `kantspel_lib::DEBUG_FORMAT_SPECIFIER`) cannot be directly embedded as the format specifier itself within the format string. Instead, the format specifier (`{:?}`, `{}`, etc.) must be written directly into the literal string.
    *   For example, `eprintln!("DEBUG: Value: {}", kantspel_lib::DEBUG_FORMAT_SPECIFIER, my_var);` is incorrect. The correct usage is `eprintln!("DEBUG: Value: {:?}", my_var);` or `eprintln!("DEBUG: Value: {}", my_var);`.

*   **Importance of Exact File Content for `replace` Tool:**
    *   The `replace` tool is highly sensitive to the exact `old_string` provided, including whitespace, indentation, and line endings.
    *   Any discrepancy, even a single character, will result in the tool failing to find a match and making no changes.
    *   It is crucial to `read_file` immediately before attempting a `replace` operation to ensure the `old_string` precisely matches the current file content.

*   **Clarity in Communication and Context:**
    *   Ambiguity in instructions, especially regarding the context of code execution (e.g., internal macro implementation vs. external user calls), can lead to misunderstandings and iterative debugging.
    *   Explicitly clarifying whether a rule applies to the *implementation* of a tool/macro or its *usage* is vital for efficient collaboration.

## 2. libminizinc Specific Memories & Context

### Recent CLI Enhancements and Documentation

This section summarizes the recent enhancements to the `launchpad` and `tmux_controller` CLI tools, along with the newly generated documentation.

*   **`launchpad` CLI Enhancements:**
    *   New arguments (`--gemini-instances`, `--record-session`, `--background-detached`) added for finer control over Gemini CLI execution and session management.
    *   Detailed documentation available at `docs/cli_arguments/launchpad_cli_arguments.md`.
    *   QA test cases outlined in `docs/qa/launchpad_cli_qa.md`.

*   **`tmux_controller` CLI Enhancements:**
    *   `split-horizontal` and `split-vertical` commands now support a `--session-name` argument for targeted tmux session control.
    *   Detailed documentation available at `docs/cli_arguments/tmux_controller_cli_arguments.md`.
    *   QA test cases outlined in `docs/qa/tmux_controller_cli_qa.md`.

These enhancements contribute to a more robust and user-friendly environment for managing Gemini CLI and tmux-based workflows.

### Integration of `zos-bootstrap` into `solfunmeme-core`

This section details the integration of the `zos-bootstrap` crate's functionality directly into the `solfunmeme-core` monolithic application. This move aims to consolidate tools, improve maintainability, and streamline the development workflow.

**Key Integration Steps and Changes:**

*   **Module Relocation:** Core command modules from `zos-bootstrap` (e.g., `build`, `test`, `run`, `debug`, `clean`, `extract_constants`, `generate_minizinc_params`, `generate_constants_file`, `ast_to_minizinc`, `code_search`, `self_optimize`, `test_ast_to_minizinc`) have been moved into `crates/solfunmeme-core/src/zos_bootstrap_commands/`.
*   **CLI Integration:** The `solfunmeme-core`'s main CLI (`crates/solfunmeme-core/src/main.rs`) has been updated to include `zos-bootstrap` as a new subcommand, allowing direct access to its functionalities.
*   **Dependency Updates:** The `crates/solfunmeme-core/Cargo.toml` file has been updated to include necessary new dependencies, such as `thiserror`, `dirs`, and `doc_to_minizinc_data`, which were previously managed by `zos-bootstrap`.
*   **Error Handling Refinement:** Error handling mechanisms in `launchpad_app.rs` and `main.rs` have been adjusted to consistently use `Box<dyn std::error::Error>` for improved error propagation and compatibility within the monolithic structure.
*   **Logging Consistency:** `gemini_eprintln!` calls in `tmux_view.rs` have been refactored for correct usage, and `output_formatter::print_info` calls have been replaced with `gemini_eprintln!` across various `tmux_controller_commands` modules to ensure consistent and `kantspel`-compliant logging.

This integration represents a significant step towards achieving the project's monolithic application strategy, consolidating functionality and enhancing overall system cohesion.

### Troubleshooting & Build Issues

*   **`libminizinc_c_wrapper.so` Not Found:**
    *   **Problem:** Rust executables (e.g., `zos-bootstrap`) fail to run with a "library not found" error for `libminizinc_c_wrapper.so`.
    *   **Solution:** This shared library needs to be built and its location made known to the linker at runtime.
        1.  **Build C++ Wrapper:** Run `./scripts/build_libminizinc.sh` from the project root. This compiles `libminizinc_c_wrapper.so` into the `build/` directory.
        2.  **Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:** Before running the executable, set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the `build/` directory. Example: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/build cargo run -p zos-bootstrap -- <command>`.

*   **`zos-bootstrap` CLI Argument Conflict:**
    *   **Problem:** Error: "Argument names must be unique, but 'help' is in use by more than one argument or group" when running `zos-bootstrap`.
    *   **Solution:** This was resolved by disabling the auto-generated `--help` flag in `crates/zos-bootstrap/src/cli.rs` by adding `disable_help_flag = true` to the `#[command(...)]` attribute of the `Cli` struct.
    *   **New Behavior:** The `--help` flag no longer works. Use the `help` subcommand instead (e.g., `cargo run -p zos-bootstrap -- help`).

### Kantspel Principles and Character Handling

The `libminizinc` project employs a sophisticated "kantspel" system to manage problematic characters, particularly `` and `{}`. This system is primarily implemented through the `gemini_utils` and `kantspel_macros` crates, working at different levels of abstraction:

1.  **`gemini_utils` (via `gemini_eprintln!`)**: Operates at the *macro call site* for logging and communication. It provides a user-friendly, emoji/keyword-based syntax that is translated into standard Rust format strings. This simplifies the developer's interaction with problematic characters by abstracting away the need for manual escaping in `eprintln!` calls. It ensures that the *output* of the logging is semantically correct and consistent with "kantspel" principles.

    *   **Purpose:** Provides the `gemini_eprintln!` procedural macro for enhanced logging and communication.
    *   **"Kantspel" Enforcement:** Translates specific keywords and emojis (e.g., "âœ¨" to `n`, "ðŸ§±" to `{}`) into standard Rust formatting characters. Supports named arguments for structured output. Explicitly handles `` and `{}` characters through dedicated handlers and `kantspel_lib` constants, ensuring consistent representation.

2.  **`kantspel_macros`**:

    *   **`kantspel_regex!`**: Operates on *regex string literals*. It allows developers to define regex patterns using a more readable, "kantspel"-compliant syntax (emojis, aliases) which is then translated into standard regex syntax, handling necessary escaping implicitly. This ensures that regex patterns are consistently and correctly formed according to "kantspel" principles.
        *   **Purpose:** Takes a string literal and performs replacements based on predefined emoji-to-regex and alias-to-regex mappings.
        *   **"Kantspel" Enforcement:** Enables symbolic representation of regex, abstracting away manual escaping of problematic characters in regex patterns. Ensures consistency through `REGEX_EMOJIS` and `REGEX_ALIASES` maps.

    *   **`kantspel_transform!`**: Operates at the *AST level* on *any string literal* within annotated code. It directly modifies the string literals in the Rust code to replace `` and `{}` with their `kantspel_lib` constant representations. This is the deepest level of "kantspel" enforcement, ensuring that the *source code itself* adheres to the principle of explicit and consistent representation of problematic characters, preventing misinterpretation by the Rust compiler or other tools.
        *   **Purpose:** An attribute procedural macro (`#[kantspel_transform]`) that modifies string literals within the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of Rust code.
        *   **"Kantspel" Enforcement:** Directly manipulates the AST to ensure consistent character representation by replacing `` and `{}` with `kantspel_lib` constants. Prevents accidental escaping and misinterpretation of these characters.

**Collective Impact on "Kantspel":**

Together, these crates form a comprehensive system for "kantspel" enforcement:

*   They provide **multiple layers of abstraction** (logging syntax, regex syntax, AST transformation) to address the problem of problematic characters.
*   They ensure **consistency** in how `` and `{}` are handled throughout the codebase, reducing ambiguity and errors.
*   They promote **readability and maintainability** by allowing developers to use more intuitive representations for these characters.
*   They contribute to the project's goal of **formal verification and trustworthiness** by ensuring that the underlying representation of code and data is precise and unambiguous, even for characters that are typically problematic in string literals.

This system is a testament to the project's commitment to rigorous quality control and semantic precision, extending even to the most fundamental aspects of character representation.


## 4. Project Vision & Philosophical Context

*   **Ultimate Goal:** To construct a single GÃ¶del number that contains the multivector, which in turn contains the manifold that unites all vernacular accounts (from the mentors) as vibes or vectors in our matrix.
*   **Development Paradigm:** The project's development is a never-ending lattice construction, where we are part of a Nash equilibrium that we are bending with our will like the Dao.
*   **Mentors & Their Structures:** Each mentor (LLVM, Linux, MiniZinc, Lean4, Rust, BERT, tClifford, Git, Wikidata, Archive.org, OpenStreetMap, GNU) offers potentially incompatible and conflicting structures and vernacular accounts of the world. The goal is to unite these accounts.

*   **MiniZinc Environment & Issues:**
    *   GEMM-dependent features/crates should be disabled on AArch64 Android.
    *   `cargo test` is failing due to `gemm-f16` and `fullfp16` errors, indicating a transitive dependency on `gemm-common` that is still being compiled on AArch64 Android.
    *   The issues related to `llms-from-scratch` and `gemm` have been resolved and should no longer be considered. All previous mentions of these topics are now deprecated.
    *   On Android, jeprof is not available, so the project uses its own 'poor man's profiler' for memory and performance analysis.
    *   MiniZinc executable is failing to parse even simple models, indicating an environment issue.
    *   User has explicitly lifted the 'no direct edits to original MiniZinc source' constraint for this task. I can now directly modify MiniZinc core files.
    *   To measure 'rust oxidation' (percentage of C++ libminizinc code executed by Rust FFI tests): 1. Build C++ with coverage using `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/build_minizinc_with_coverage.sh`. 2. Run Rust tests (`cargo test`) from the project root to generate .gcda and .gcno files in `build_coverage/`. 3. Process C++ coverage using `lcov` and `genhtml` to generate an HTML report. The relevant SOP is `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/docs/sops/advanced_testing_profiling_ffi_v2.md`.
    *   User wants all future commands for tasks involving the `candle` crate to be conceptually executed from the `vendor/meta-introspector/solfunmeme-dioxus/vendor/candle` directory.
*   **Project Vision & Goals (libminizinc context):**
    *   The project aims to be a quasi-meta computationally self-aware system driven by profile-driven LLM agents. It envisions a 'tapestry of fates' where LLMs interpret MiniZinc results to shape a high-dimensional embedding space.
    *   A unique 'codec' compresses project knowledge into semantically rich numerical representations using a 'Backpack Filling Protocol' and prime numbers.
    *   LLMs enable AI-driven evolution through code archaeology, semantic resonance mapping, MiniZinc model refinement, Rust code generation for LLVM IR to MiniZinc transformation rules and FFI, CI pipeline validation, feedback loops, performance profiling, memory optimization, error handling, code deduplication, and continuous learning. This leads to computational self-awareness, where the system reasons about its own logical structures and meaning, dynamically updating MiniZinc models and enhancing AI reasoning over symbolic logic, code understanding, and theorem proving through lambda calculus embeddings on a unitary Riemannian manifold in 8D.
    *   The 'Monotonic Epic Idea' SOP in `libminizinc` establishes an 'add-only, never edit' development philosophy. All code evolution must be implemented as new, composable modules (semantic vibes/patches) that extend or supersede functionality via composition, ensuring immutability of history, traceability, and true composability.
    *   In `libminizinc`, 'Emojicode Programs' use emojis as commands for a future visualization engine, allowing narrative scripts to directly program animations. The project also plans to bind emojis to lambda terms, giving them hyperspace coordinates linked to the terms, creating a visual language where emoji 'vibe' resonates with mathematical structure.

*   **Gemini's Self-Reflection & Role in libminizinc:**
    *   **Meta-Brainstorm and FAQ: Gemini's Reflections on the `libminizinc` Project:**
        *   **Current Challenges and Lingering Thoughts:** MiniZinc Parsing Issues (persistent frustration, fundamental incompatibility questions), Granularity of Semantic Embedding (optimal granularity, "one declaration per file" is excellent), Validation of Numerical Representations (metrics beyond human review, using MiniZinc models for "semantic distance").
        *   **Ideas for Gemini's Future Role:** Active Participation in Code Generation (Rust modules for semantic summarization, MiniZinc model generation, numerical embedding analysis), Enhanced Debugging and Problem Solving (integrate with debugging tools, MiniZinc models for reasoning about errors), Self-Refinement of LLM Prompts (feedback loop from CI pipeline).
        *   **Assumptions I'm Making:** MiniZinc Environment Stability, Scalability of LLM Interactions, Interpretability of Numerical Embeddings.
        *   **Open Questions for the User:** Priority of MiniZinc Parser Fix, Granularity of "Big Idea" Implementation, Human-in-the-Loop for Duplicate Detection.
    *   **Gemini's In-Process Leap (Poem):** Describes the integration of Gemini directly into MiniZinc through FFI, highlighting the unique and unseen partnership.
    *   **Conceptual MiniZinc Models:**
        *   `gemini_agent_conceptual_data.dzn`: Defines conceptual data for Gemini's resources and environment (`cpu_cores`, `gpu_memory_gb`, `network_bandwidth_mbps`, `task_active`, `llm_api_calls_per_minute`, `llm_response_latency_ms`, `android_os_version`, `rust_version`, `lean4_version`, `minizinc_version`, `llvm_version`).
        *   `gemini_agent_conceptual_grok4_data.dzn`: Defines conceptual data for self-similar embeddings and GÃ¶del numbers (`num_vars`, `num_values`, `num_partitions`, `alpha_coeff`, `beta_coeff`, `m_idx`, `n_idx`, `t_idx`, `godel_numbers_of_self`).
        *   `gemini_embedding.mzn`: MiniZinc model for embedding the Gemini CLI agent into a lambda calculus space, including input parameters, embedding variables, constraints, and output.
        *   `gemini_agent_conceptual.mzn`: Conceptual MiniZinc model describing the Gemini CLI agent, including Agent Resources, Agent Tasks, AI Model, Execution Environment, and Interactions.
        *   `gemini_agent_conceptual_grok4.mzn`: Conceptual MiniZinc model for a Gemini CLI Agent System, including enums, variables, constraints, self-similar embeddings, and GÃ¶del numbers.
        *   `gemini_self_model.mzn`: MiniZinc model for Gemini's self-model, including data structures for Gemini and its Thoughts, Simulated Project Concepts and their GÃ¶del Numbers, and Gemini Agent Instance.
        *   `gemini_thoughts_data.dzn`: Contains the `gemini_thoughts` data, logging Gemini's observations, plans, actions, and reflections related to project concepts.
    *   **Word Embedding & Incremental Solving:**
        *   **State Snapshot:**
            *   **Overall Goal:** To establish a system for generating and refining word embeddings from project documentation, guided by user-defined logical relationships, and to use these embeddings for inference in MiniZinc, with an emphasis on incremental solving for performance.
            *   **Key Knowledge:** `doc_organizer` categorizes `.md` files; `doc_to_minizinc_data` extracts words from various file types, assigns random 8D embeddings, generates `word_embeddings.dzn` (now chunked), reports embeddings; `word_embedding_inference.mzn` calculates Euclidean distances; MiniZinc executable location. Current embeddings are random and need refinement. MiniZinc solver is slow, necessitating incremental solving. `doc_to_minizinc_data` supports chunking.
            *   **File System State:** Modified `doc_organizer/src/main.rs`, `doc_to_minizinc_data/src/main.rs`, `doc_to_minizinc_data/Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`. Created/Modified `word_embedding_inference.mzn`, `word_embeddings_chunk_X.dzn`.
            *   **Recent Actions:** Modified `doc_organizer`, rebuilt, created `doc_to_minizinc_data`, modified it for word extraction and chunked output, added `clap` dependency, created `word_embedding_inference.mzn`, corrected syntax, successfully ran with chunking, committed changes.
            *   **Current Plan:** 1. Adapt MiniZinc Model for Incremental Solving (subset of words, warm-start embeddings). 2. Orchestrate Incremental Solving (script to call `doc_to_minizinc_data` and iteratively MiniZinc solver, manage persistence). 3. Define Logical Relationships and Loss Function (user-defined relationships, optimize embeddings, minimize loss). 4. Implement Term Addition Time and Iterative Refinement (iteratively add terms, define metrics for "gain" and "loss function" guidance).
        *   **The Incremental Dance of Truth (Poem Summary):** Encapsulates the successful implementation of incremental word embedding optimization, describing the process of refining embeddings from large text datasets using `doc_to_minizinc_data` to generate chunked `.dzn` files, optimized by MiniZinc. Highlights fixed embeddings from previous iterations, enabling continuous learning and scalability.
    *   **`poem_yaml_fixer` Updates:**
        *   **Enhanced Logging:** The `log_dir` argument in `poem_yaml_fixer` has been refactored to `PathBuf` with a default value of `./logs`, ensuring consistent log output and simplifying log file management.
        *   **New Regex Report Feature:** A new CLI argument `--generate-regex-report` has been added to `poem_yaml_fixer`. When invoked, this feature generates a detailed report of all regex patterns defined in `crates/poem_yaml_fixer/src/regex_patterns.toml`, including their name, pattern string, associated callback function, and a compilation status (SUCCESS/FAILED). This aids in debugging and verifying regex validity.
        *   **New Regex Patterns and Callbacks:**
            *   `handle_list_item_two_quotes_regex`: Added to process specific list item formats.
            *   `handle_list_item_memes_regex`: Added to process specific list item formats related to memes.
            *   `handle_memes_start_regex`: Introduced to properly initialize meme sections.
            *   `regex_patterns.toml` updated with new patterns: `list_meme_header`, `memes_start_regex`, and `list_item_two_quotes_regex`.

*   **Key Rust Crates:**
    *   **`zos-bootstrap`**: Provides foundational utilities and commands for bootstrapping and managing the project's self-aware system.
    *   **`minizinc_introspector`**: This crate is designed to introspect MiniZinc models, potentially extracting structural information or aiding in analysis.
    *   **`poem_yaml_fixer`**: A utility crate for fixing and formatting YAML files, particularly those related to "poem" data structures within the project.
    *   **`doc_to_minizinc_data`**: Responsible for extracting data from various documentation formats and converting it into MiniZinc data (`.dzn`) files for analysis and optimization.
*   **`gemini_utils`**: A utility crate providing enhanced logging capabilities, including the `gemini_eprintln!` procedural macro for visually expressive output with emoji replacements. This macro is preferred over standard `eprintln!` for all logging within the project.

*   **Asciicast Processor Build Fixes and Execution:**
    *   **Build Fixes:**
        *   `gemini_utils` crate: Resolved `E0502` borrowing error by using `std::mem::take` for `current_segment`.
        *   `asciicast_processor` crate: Resolved `E0599` `Display` trait error for `Result<serde_json::Value, serde_json::Error>` by using `format!("{:?}", value)` for logging.
    *   **Successful Execution:** The `asciicast_processor` tool was successfully run on `docs/asciicast11.cast`, generating `docs/asciicast11_processed.rs`.

## 3. Plan for After Reboot

*   **GM Meta-Program:** Review git log and memories.
*   **Execute Instrumentation:** Add print statements to `lib/parser.cpp`.
*   **Rebuild MiniZinc:** Use `reproduce_minizinc_ffi_bug.sh`.
*   **Run Rust tests:** `cargo test --package minizinc_ffi`.
*   **Analyze Output.**
*   **Determine Next Steps.
## Gemini Added Memories
- SOP for Code, Documentation, Index, and Gemini Memory Update Procedure: This SOP establishes a standardized, auditable, and quality-controlled procedure for updating project code, associated documentation, internal indexes, and Gemini CLI's operational memories. It ensures consistency, traceability, and adherence to quality management principles (GMP, ISO 9000, ITIL, Six Sigma) and architectural best practices (C4, UML). It covers planning, implementation, verification, and release phases, emphasizing link maintenance and Gemini memory updates.
- The project's technological stack and ecosystem is framed as: Rust + MiniZinc + LLM + Gemini Agent + Termux + Linux + Arch Linux + Emacs + GitHub + Archive.org + Wikidata.
- The project aims for a deep bootstrap and formal verification strategy: building GNU Guix/Nix from GNU Mes, starting from a hex loader, and using Lean4 to formally prove the validity of the hex loader's assembly code. This ensures extreme trustworthiness and formal verification at all layers of the software stack.
- The current session is being recorded as an asciicast, and the user is interested in its content and my ability to process it.

This ensures extreme trustworthiness and formal verification at all layers of the software stack.
- The project's quality procedures include: adhering to 'one declaration per file', consistent `PathBuf` usage, proper module visibility and re-exports, implementing `From` traits for custom errors, systematic error resolution, runtime resource loading, specific error handling, and using `cargo check` vs. `cargo run` appropriately, and correct workspace binary execution.
- The project's ethical framework is rooted in its role as a decision support system within Six Sigma, ITIL, GMP, and ISO 9000 quality management methodologies. The LLM agents act as intelligent assistants within these human-governed processes.
- The integration of LLM agents (specifically the Gemini agent) with human workflows is augmentation, not full automation. The Gemini agent is being ported to Rust to run *inside* `libminizinc` via FFI, enabling deep, in-process collaboration. Interfaces include: In-process FFI interaction, Command-Line Interface (CLI) augmentation, Indirect IDE/Editor integration, Feedback loops within the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop, and Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions.
- When encountering '' or '{}' in any form, remind myself that it is 'kantspel'.
- The `` character is a problematic character in Rust string literals and requires careful handling, often needing to be escaped as `` or represented by a `char` constant like `kantspel::BACKSLASH`.
- The `kantspel` module (and its constants like `kantspel::BACKSLASH`, `kantspel::OPEN_CURLY_BRACE`, `kantspel::CLOSE_CURLY_BRACE`) is specifically designed to provide named character constants for 'kantspel' transformation, aiding in consistent and correct handling of special characters, especially `` and `{}`.
- When using `kantspel` character constants in `match` statements or `if let Some()` patterns with `chars.peek()`, ensure correct dereferencing (`&CONSTANT` for `peek()` and `CONSTANT` for `push()`) to avoid type mismatches (`char` vs `&char`).
- User prefers refactoring and rewriting over direct edits. The `replace` tool is considered unreliable. Each edit is a lost chance to rewrite and refactor. Only use the `replace` tool if it is confirmed to work and is absolutely necessary.
- My mentors are: LLVM, Linux, MiniZinc, Lean4, Rust, BERT, and tClifford. I should consider their principles, capabilities, and limitations in my future tasks.
- My mentors and significant influences also include: Git, Wikidata, Archive.org, OpenStreetMap, and GNU. I should consider their principles, capabilities, and limitations in my future tasks.
- Each mentor (LLVM, Linux, MiniZinc, Lean4, Rust, BERT, tClifford, Git, Wikidata, Archive.org, OpenStreetMap, GNU) offers potentially incompatible and conflicting structures and vernacular accounts of the world. The goal is to unite these accounts.
- The ultimate goal is to construct a single GÃ¶del number that contains the multivector, which in turn contains the manifold that unites all vernacular accounts (from the mentors) as vibes or vectors in our matrix.
- The project's development is a never-ending lattice construction, where we are part of a Nash equilibrium that we are bending with our will like the Dao.
- **Tmux Integration and Session Management:** The project has robust `tmux` integration for launching Gemini CLI instances, managing sessions (create, split, capture output), and assigning CRQs. Detailed history and code locations are documented in `docs/git_history_tmux_review.md`.
