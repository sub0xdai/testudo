# üèõÔ∏è Testudo Trading Platform

> *"In trading, as in war, discipline separates victory from defeat."*

**Testudo** is a disciplined crypto trading platform that implements Van Tharp position sizing methodology with Roman military precision and systematic risk management. Built in Rust for performance, safety, and mathematical accuracy.

## üéØ Core Mission

Remove human emotion from position sizing decisions through formal mathematical verification, enabling traders to focus on market analysis while the platform handles all risk calculations with 99.9% accuracy and sub-200ms execution latency.

## üèõÔ∏è Roman Military Principles

- **Disciplina**: Mathematical precision without deviation in all financial calculations
- **Formatio**: Systematic execution following the OODA Loop under all market conditions  
- **Prudentia**: Risk-aware decision making in all trading operations
- **Imperium**: Clear command structure and decisive action under pressure

## ‚ö° Key Features

- **Automated Van Tharp Position Sizing**: `Position Size = (Account Equity √ó Risk %) √∑ (Entry - Stop)`
- **Testudo Protocol Risk Management**: A complete, verified risk engine enforces individual trade limits, portfolio exposure caps, and circuit breakers for consecutive losses.
- **OODA Loop Trading**: Systematic Observe ‚Üí Orient ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Act execution cycle
- **Drag-to-Trade Interface**: Intuitive chart-based order placement with automatic sizing
- **Sub-200ms Latency**: High-performance order execution and market data processing
- **Comprehensive Trade Journal**: Automatic logging with R-multiple analysis

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Core Components (Roman Military Organization)

- **Disciplina** (`crates/disciplina`): Van Tharp risk calculation engine with formal verification
- **Formatio** (`crates/formatio`): OODA loop trading operations and execution logic
- **Prudentia** (`crates/prudentia`): Risk management protocol and exchange integration adapters
- **Imperium** (`crates/imperium`): API server and command interface

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Rust (Tokio + Axum) monolithic architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for time-series trade data
- **Cache**: Redis for real-time market data and position state - This has changed
- **Frontend**: Progressive Web App (Rust Framework)
- **Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts integration
- **Monitoring**: Sentry error tracking, Prometheus metrics

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ with Cargo
- PostgreSQL 14+ with TimescaleDB extension
- Redis 6+
- Binance API credentials (for exchange integration)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:sub0xdai/testudo.git
cd testudo

# Install Rust dependencies
cargo build --release

# Set up database
createdb testudo
psql testudo -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;"

# Run database migrations
cargo run --bin migrate

# Copy configuration template
cp config/default.toml config/local.toml
# Edit config/local.toml with your settings

# Start the platform
cargo run --bin testudo --config config/local.toml
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install development dependencies
cargo install sqlx-cli
cargo install cargo-watch

# Start development server with auto-reload
cargo watch -x "run --bin testudo"

# Run tests (including property-based verification)
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

## üìä Performance Targets

- **Order Execution**: <200ms from UI interaction to exchange confirmation
- **Position Calculation**: <50ms Van Tharp formula execution  
- **Market Data Latency**: <100ms WebSocket price updates
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability during market hours
- **Calculation Accuracy**: Zero tolerance for mathematical errors

## üîí Security Model

- **API Key Storage**: AES-256 encrypted exchange credentials
- **Network Security**: TLS 1.3 for all external communications
- **Database Protection**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- **Access Control**: JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all trading operations

## üìã Configuration

Key configuration sections in `config/default.toml`:

```toml
[risk_management]
default_risk_percentage = 0.02  # 2% default risk per trade
max_risk_percentage = 0.06     # 6% maximum risk allowed
max_portfolio_risk = 0.10      # 10% total portfolio risk limit

[ooda]
max_loop_duration = "200ms"    # Complete OODA cycle target
max_market_data_age = "5s"     # Market data freshness limit

[exchanges.binance]
api_key = ""  # Set via environment variable
api_secret = ""  # Set via environment variable  
```

## üß™ Testing

The platform includes comprehensive testing with formal verification:

```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test

# Property-based testing (10,000+ iterations)
cargo test prop_ -- --ignored

# Performance benchmarks
cargo bench position_sizing

# Integration tests
cargo test --test integration

# Security audit
cargo audit
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

Following GEMINI principles for monotonic development:

1. **Add-Only Philosophy**: Never modify existing risk calculation rules
2. **Property-Based Testing**: All financial math verified with 10,000+ test iterations
3. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs required for core algorithms
4. **SOP-Driven**: Every operation follows documented Standard Operating Procedures
