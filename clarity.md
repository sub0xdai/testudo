# Testudo Trading Platform - Requirements Discovery Session

## Overview
This document captures the comprehensive requirements gathering process for the Testudo Trading Platform. As a senior PM/engineer specializing in Rust-based financial applications, this structured questionnaire will define our functional and non-functional requirements to create the ultimate trading platform vision.

---

## **Phase 1: Strategic Vision & Business Context**

### 1.1 Stack Migration Rationale
**Question:** What drove the decision to move away from the current stack to Rust? Are you optimizing for performance, safety, developer productivity, or something else entirely?

**Answer:** 
_Rust is highly performant_

### 1.2 Target User Profile
**Question:** Who is the primary target user for Testudo in your mind - retail crypto traders, institutional clients, or both? What's their typical account size and trading frequency?

**Answer:** 
_Retail crypto traders_

### 1.3 Market Differentiation
**Question:** What specific problem does Testudo solve that existing platforms (Binance, FTX, dYdX) don't address adequately?

**Answer:** 
_Testudo will oprovide a truly holistic tradign enviroment that enforces risk management and takes away the desisions of position size and trade management. It is jus tthe chart and the exectuion tool, which resemebles a long short position tool, which is drag on the chart. so drag, and it places limit order on click, then drag down to place stop and drag up for the take profit - and then the position size is automatically calculated and postion is placed. Then there will be a trade journal section resembling fxblue to really get into how your performaing over 1000s of trades or 100s._

### 1.4 Minimalist Definition
**Question:** When you say "minimalist" - are you thinking more like Robinhood's simplicity, or Bloomberg Terminal's focused density? What does "cognitive load reduction" look like in practice?

**Answer:** 
_Robinhoods simplicity. Just a chart, a tool, ample pairs to trade, and the analysis of the fx blue style journal. This will be built as a seperate component. We will also have scope for a token launch down the track to launch a token on solana_

## **Phase 2: Core Trading Workflows**

### 2.1 Ideal User Journey
**Question:** Walk me through your ideal user journey: A trader opens Testudo, sees a setup, and executes a trade. What are the exact steps from login to position closure?

**Answer:** 
_A user will see the landing page, setup an account, and be taken through the setup of the account. The user will be able to choose the risk profile , up to 6% per trade. There may be other setup steps like advanced trade management. The user will then input exchange api, or connect there wallet if we go the web3 route. Once live, they will have access to the charts (Advanced chart library from trading view) and the postion sizing tool. It will look like a trading terminal. Slick, low latency. There will be buttons for settings, and a dashboard section which might have other accounts with ofther exchanges and risk profiles. There will also be the "journal" section accessible through buttons, all of which will be on the navbar or a slick burger menu. The user will be able to either go long or go short, drag the tool and it will place limit orders. And thats it_

### 2.2 Position Sizing Strategy Options
**Question:** For position sizing - should Van Tharp's method be the ONLY option, or do you want multiple sizing strategies (fixed dollar, percentage, Kelly Criterion, etc.)?

**Answer:** 
_There could be multiple sizing strategies, but the van tharp method is a great one for a mvp_

### 2.3 Trade Management Automation Level
**Question:** How automated do you want trade management? Should stops move to breakeven automatically, or give users control? What about partial profit-taking?

**Answer:** 
_Automatic trade management should be optional, setup in the settings per account basis, and with w toggle function_

### 2.4 Exchange Integration Scope
**Question:** What exchanges do you need to support initially vs. eventually? Any preference for CEX vs DEX integration?

**Answer:** 
_Binance or bybit, or if we go DEX just an option with highest volume. We might do cex first and binance first as it is high volume, and good docs_

---

## **Phase 3: User Experience Priorities**

### 3.1 Roman Military Theme Implementation
**Question:** The Roman military theme - how prominent should this be? Subtle visual cues, or full thematic immersion with terminology like "Command Center"?

**Answer:** 
_The frontend can have some thematic immersion, and associated lore. Also the ideals of discipline and stoicism, miltarism, precsion. This should be enforced through the platform and the coding best practices_

### 3.2 Device & Platform Support
**Question:** What devices/screen sizes are critical? Desktop-first, mobile-responsive, or native mobile apps?

**Answer:** 
_desktop first - mobile responsive but its an afterthought_

### 3.3 Chart Interface Design
**Question:** For the "drag-and-drop" chart interface - are you envisioning something like TradingView's drawing tools, or more like a simplified order placement overlay?

**Answer:** 
_Something like tradingviews drawing tools_

### 3.4 Customization vs. Opinionated Defaults
**Question:** How important is customization vs. opinionated defaults? Should users configure everything, or trust the system's intelligence?

**Answer:** 
_Trust systems intelligence_

---

## **Phase 4: Technical Performance Requirements**

### 4.1 Latency & Speed Targets
**Question:** What's your acceptable latency for order execution? Should we target <50ms, <100ms, or <200ms from click to exchange acknowledgment?

**Answer:** 
_< 200ms or just the lowest that can be achieved_

### 4.2 Data Feed Requirements
**Question:** For real-time market data, do you need full order book depth, or just best bid/ask? What about historical data - how many candles should we store locally for chart rendering?

**Answer:** 
_I thought the exchange will provide the data? It should be simialr to trading on the exchange, but we do not need a huge amount of historical data in our app._

### 4.3 Concurrent User Scaling
**Question:** For MVP, are you thinking 100 concurrent users, 1,000, or 10,000? This affects our architecture decisions significantly.

**Answer:** 
_100-1000_

### 4.4 Trade Journal Analytics
**Question:** For the FxBlue-style journal, what specific metrics are critical? (Win rate, profit factor, R-multiples, drawdown curves, Monte Carlo simulations, etc.)

**Answer:** 
_All the above, but the trade journal is beyond the initial scope of project. We defientyl need to plan for it regarding the database archtiecture so maybe timeseriesdb and postgress etc_

---

## **Phase 5: Risk Management & Compliance**

### 5.1 Position Limits
**Question:** Should there be a maximum position size limit regardless of account size? Any maximum number of concurrent open positions?

**Answer:** 
_Maybe a maximum of 10% risk per all open positions. But if there is a cover trade it could potentially factor that in_

### 5.2 Account Protection
**Question:** Beyond the 6% per-trade risk, should we implement daily loss limits? Weekly? Should the platform lock trading after X consecutive losses?

**Answer:** 
_Yes and we should follow best practice - for example, a prop firm will have standards around this, and we should adopt this approach_

### 5.3 Leverage & Margin
**Question:** What's the maximum leverage you want to allow? Should this vary by user experience level or account size?

**Answer:** 
_Leverage is irrelevant its all about the position sizing - so it can be exchange dependent_

### 5.4 Order Validation
**Question:** How should the platform handle situations where calculated position size exceeds available margin or exchange limits?

**Answer:** 
_The system will not allow this situation to arise_

---

## **Phase 6: Architecture & Infrastructure**

### 6.1 Backend Architecture
**Question:** For the Rust backend, are you comfortable with Tokio for async runtime, or do you have preferences? Should we use a microservices approach or monolithic?

**Answer:** 
_I will allow you to ascertain which might be the best option based on the GEMINI.md_

### 6.2 Frontend Framework
**Question:** For desktop-first with that "slick terminal" feel, are you thinking Tauri (Rust-based), Electron, or a web app? This affects performance and distribution.

**Answer:** 
_It depends on weather it would be ideal to make a web app or a desktop native app I suppose. Performance is important but so is accessibility_

### 6.3 Database Strategy
**Question:** For the journal analytics, we'll need time-series data. PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension, or separate InfluxDB/QuestDB for market data?

**Answer:** 
_Postgress and timescale_

### 6.4 State Management
**Question:** For real-time position updates, should we use WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or gRPC streaming?

**Answer:** 
_I would lean towards websockets but i can be convinced otherwise if it makes sense to_

---

## **Phase 7: Success Metrics & KPIs**

### 7.1 Launch Goals
**Question:** What constitutes a successful MVP launch? Number of users, trading volume, or specific feature completeness?

**Answer:** 
_1000 users will be amazing_

### 7.2 Revenue Model
**Question:** How does Testudo make money? Subscription, per-trade fees, or freemium with advanced features? This affects our architecture.

**Answer:** 
_It should probably be a subscription, with a free period of 1 week then locked behind a paywall. Something like this_

### 7.3 Platform Reliability
**Question:** What uptime target? 99.9% (8.7 hours downtime/year) or 99.99% (52 minutes/year)?

**Answer:** 
_99.9% is probably sufficient_

### 7.4 Future Token Integration
**Question:** For the Solana token launch, should the platform architecture prepare for token-gated features or staking rewards from day one?

**Answer:** 
_No we can pivot to this later_
