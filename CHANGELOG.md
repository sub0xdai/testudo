## Historical Context

The Testudo (tortoise) formation was a Roman military tactic where soldiers would align shields to form a protective barrier on all sides. This project embodies the same principle: systematic protection of capital through disciplined, mathematically verified position sizing.

Like the Roman legions that conquered through discipline rather than emotion, Testudo removes human psychology from position sizing decisions, relying instead on Van Tharp's proven mathematical methodology.
