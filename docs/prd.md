# Minimalist Trading Application - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the development of **Testudo**, a disciplined crypto trading platform that implements Van Tharp-style position sizing and risk management principles through a Roman military-inspired systematic approach. The application aims to reduce cognitive load and decision fatigue for traders by automating trade sizing calculations and risk management protocols while maintaining a clean, distraction-free user interface.

The purpose of this document is to provide comprehensive specifications for the development team, ensuring all stakeholders understand the product vision, technical requirements, and user experience objectives for this trading platform. Testudo embodies the principles of **Disciplina** (mathematical precision), **Formatio** (systematic execution), **Prudentia** (risk-aware decision making), and **Imperium** (clear command structure).

## 2. Product overview

**Testudo** is a high-performance crypto trading platform built with Rust, designed around Roman military principles of discipline and systematic execution. The platform integrates directly with cryptocurrency exchanges (starting with Binance) via secure API connections and provides real-time trading capabilities with automated Van Tharp position sizing through an intuitive drag-based interface.
