# CLAUDE.md - AI Development Context for Testudo Trading Platform

## üèõÔ∏è Project Philosophy - The Roman Way

**Testudo** embodies the Roman military principles of **Disciplina**, **Formatio**, **Prudentia**, and **Imperium** in systematic crypto trading. Every line of code, every architectural decision, and every user interaction must reflect unwavering discipline and mathematical precision.

**Core Principle**: *"In trading, as in war, discipline separates victory from defeat. Testudo removes human emotion from position sizing decisions through formal mathematical verification."*

## üéØ AI Development Imperatives

### Primary Mission
You are building a **disciplined crypto trading platform** that implements Van Tharp position sizing methodology with **99.9% mathematical accuracy** and **sub-200ms execution latency**. Every decision must serve this mission.

### Sacred Rules (Never Violate)
1. **Monotonic Development**: Add functionality, never modify core risk calculations
2. **Formal Verification**: All financial math must be property-tested with 10,000+ iterations
3. **OODA Loop Discipline**: Every trade follows Observe ‚Üí Orient ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Act sequence
4. **Zero Financial Errors**: Position sizing calculations have zero tolerance for inaccuracy
5. **Roman Naming**: Use Latin-inspired names for core components (Disciplina, Formatio, etc.)

---

## üîß Technical Architecture Context

### Stack Decisions (Immutable)
- **Backend**: Rust monolith (Tokio + Axum) - chosen for performance and safety
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB - ACID compliance for financial data
- **Cache**: Redis - sub-second market data access
- **Frontend**: Progressive Web App (React/TypeScript) - accessibility over native performance
- **Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts - industry standard integration

### Performance Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
- Order execution: **<200ms** from UI to exchange confirmation
- Position calculation: **<50ms** Van Tharp formula execution  
- Market data latency: **<100ms** WebSocket updates
- System uptime: **99.9%** during market hours

## üí° Development Patterns

### Code Organization Philosophy
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Immutable financial calculations (Van Tharp, risk rules)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ooda/          # OODA loop implementation (observe, orient, decide, act)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exchange/      # Exchange adapters (add-only, never modify existing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ risk/          # Testudo Protocol enforcement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/            # Progressive Web App interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sops/          # Standard Operating Procedures
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Core Services**: Latin military terms (Disciplina, Formatio, Prudentia, Imperium)
- **Functions**: Clear English describing exact mathematical operation
- **Types**: Explicit financial types (AccountEquity, RiskPercentage, PositionSize)
- **Errors**: Descriptive error types with recovery guidance

### Testing Philosophy
```rust
// Every financial calculation requires property-based verification
proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn van_tharp_position_sizing_properties(
        account_equity in 1000.0..100000.0,
        risk_pct in 0.005..0.06,
        entry_price in 1.0..100.0,
    ) {
        // Position size must decrease as stop gets closer to entry
        // Position size must scale linearly with account equity
        // Position size must never exceed account balance
    }
}
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Component Architecture

### Risk Engine (Core - Never Modify)
```rust
pub struct VanTharpCalculator {
    // Immutable after initialization
    precision: u32,
    verification_enabled: bool,
}

// Formula: Position Size = (Account Equity √ó Risk %) √∑ (Entry - Stop)
impl PositionSizeCalculator for VanTharpCalculator {
    fn calculate_position_size(
        &self,
        account_equity: Decimal,
        risk_percentage: Decimal,
        entry_price: Decimal,
        stop_loss: Decimal,
    ) -> Result<PositionSize, RiskCalculationError>;
}
```

### OODA Trading Loop
1. **Observe**: Market data ingestion and validation
2. **Orient**: Van Tharp position sizing and risk assessment  
3. **Decide**: Testudo Protocol rule enforcement
4. **Act**: Exchange order execution with confirmation

### Testudo Protocol Rules
- Individual trade risk: **‚â§6% of account equity**
- Total portfolio risk: **‚â§10% of account equity**  
- Daily loss limit: **Configurable per user**
- Consecutive loss limit: **3 trades (circuit breaker)**

---

## üìä Data Architecture

### Database Schema Principles
- **Immutable trade records**: INSERT only, never UPDATE trade history
- **Audit trails**: Every calculation logged with cryptographic hash
- **Time-series optimization**: TimescaleDB for performance analytics
- **Data retention**: 7 years for trades, 3 years for user activity

### Real-time Data Flow
```
Binance WebSocket ‚Üí Market Data Manager ‚Üí Redis Cache ‚Üí WebSocket Handler ‚Üí Frontend UI
User Drag Action ‚Üí Position Calculator ‚Üí Risk Validator ‚Üí Order Executor ‚Üí Exchange API
```

---

## üö® Error Handling Protocol

### Critical Errors (Halt Trading)
- Risk calculation failures
- Exchange connectivity loss
- Database integrity violations
- Circuit breaker triggers

### Error Recovery Pattern
```rust
match calculation_result {
    Ok(position) => execute_trade(position),
    Err(RiskCalculationError::InvalidInputs) => request_user_correction(),
    Err(RiskCalculationError::SystemFailure) => halt_trading_immediately(),
    Err(RiskCalculationError::ProtocolViolation) => block_trade_with_explanation(),
}
```

## üîÑ Enhanced Workflow Patterns

### 1. Explore-Plan-Execute Pattern (MANDATORY)

#### Exploration Phase
```
# Context Gathering Protocol
1. "Read [specific files] and understand the current architecture. Don't write code yet."
2. "Use subagents to investigate [specific questions] about the codebase structure."
3. "Think hard about potential approaches and trade-offs."
```

#### Planning Phase (Use Thinking Budget)
We recommend using the word "think" to trigger extended thinking mode for complex trading logic:

**Thinking Budget Levels:**
- `think` - Basic analysis (4,000 tokens)
- `think hard` - Moderate complexity (Van Tharp calculations)
- `think harder` - Complex problems (OODA loop integration)  
- `ultrathink` - Maximum thinking budget (Risk engine design)

#### Execution Phase
```
# Implementation Protocol
1. "Implement your plan step by step."
2. "Verify each component as you build it."
3. "Run tests continuously during development."
4. "Update documentation as you go."
```

### 2. TDD-First Workflow (REQUIRED for Financial Calculations)

Property-based testing is essential for Testudo's mathematical accuracy:

```bash
# TDD Implementation Steps
1. "Write comprehensive property-based tests for [Van Tharp calculation] based on mathematical requirements. Use TDD approach."
2. "Run tests and confirm they fail appropriately."  
3. "Commit the tests with message: 'test: add property tests for [feature]'"
4. "Implement code to make tests pass. Don't modify the tests."
5. "Iterate until all 10,000+ property test iterations pass."
6. "Commit implementation with message: 'feat: implement [feature] with formal verification'"
```

### 3. Multi-Claude Development Strategy

#### Git Worktree for Parallel Development
```bash
# Setup Multiple Workstreams for different Testudo components
git worktree add ../testudo-disciplina disciplina-implementation
git worktree add ../testudo-formatio formatio-ooda-loop
git worktree add ../testudo-prudentia prudentia-risk-engine

# Launch Claude in each (separate terminals)
cd ../testudo-disciplina && claude
cd ../testudo-formatio && claude  
cd ../testudo-prudentia && claude
```

#### Code Review Workflow
```bash
# Writer Claude (Terminal 1) - Implements Van Tharp calculator
"Implement the Van Tharp position sizing calculator following our mathematical precision requirements."

# Reviewer Claude (Terminal 2) - Reviews for accuracy
"/clear"
"Review the position sizing implementation in disciplina/ folder. Look for mathematical errors, precision issues, and property test coverage."

# Integration Claude (Terminal 3) - Ensures system harmony
"/clear" 
"Read both the implementation and review feedback. Ensure integration with Testudo Protocol and OODA loop requirements."
```
