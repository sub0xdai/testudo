# Master Claude: Enhanced Best Practices 2025

## Executive Summary
This document provides a comprehensive framework for maximizing productivity with Claude Code through strategic setup, proven workflows, and advanced optimization techniques. Claude Code is intentionally low-level and unopinionated, providing close to raw model access without forcing specific workflows, making proper methodology crucial for success.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Strategic Setup & Architecture

### Core Repository Structure (example)
```bash
## Architecture Overview
This is a full-stack customer intelligence platform with:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ App Router with TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI with LlamaIndex for AI/ML capabilities  
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- **Deployment**: Frontend on Vercel, Backend on fly.io

## Frontend Structure
The frontend uses Next.js App Router with feature-based organization:
- `app/` - App Router pages and API routes
- `actions/` - Server actions for API calls (e.g., `addBatch.ts`, `runBatchAnswer.ts`)
- `components/` - Feature-based React components
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Backend Structure
The backend is a FastAPI application with:
- `backend/py` - FastAPI app entry point
- `backend/question_answering/app/` - Main application code
  - `api/routes/` - API endpoints
  - `core/` - Configuration and LlamaIndex setup
  - `services/` - Business logic (answer_service, file_upload_service, etc.)
  - `schemas/` - Pydantic models for API contracts
```

### Enhanced CLAUDE.md Framework

#### Primary CLAUDE.md (Root Level)
```markdown
# Project Architecture & Core Commands

## Essential Commands
- `npm run build` - Build the project
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript checker
- `npm run test` - Run test suite (prefer single tests for performance)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run format` - Run Prettier formatter

## Code Standards
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (e.g., `import { foo } from 'bar'`)
- Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Write tests BEFORE implementation (TDD approach)

## Development Workflow
- Always run typecheck after code changes
- Use pre-commit hooks for quality gates
- Run single tests during development, full suite before commits
- Update this CLAUDE.md when you discover new patterns or solutions

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Linting rules followed
- Code coverage maintained above 80%

## Architecture Principles
- Feature-based folder organization
- Clear separation of concerns (API, business logic, UI)
- Dependency injection for testability
- Error boundaries and graceful degradation
```

#### Feature-Specific CLAUDE.md Files
Create `claude.md` files for major subfolders:

```markdown
# Frontend Components (components/claude.md)

## Component Patterns
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all prop types
- Implement error boundaries for complex components  
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms ‚Üí molecules ‚Üí organisms)
- Use React.memo for performance optimization

## State Management
- Use React Query for server state
- Zustand for client state management
- Context sparingly, only for truly global state

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests with React Testing Library
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Visual regression tests for UI components

## References
When Claude needs component examples, reference:
- `components/ui/` - Base atomic components
- `components/feature/` - Feature-specific components
- `__tests__/` - Test patterns and utilities
```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Permission Management
Use the `/permissions` command after starting Claude Code to add or remove tools from the allowlist. Recommended allowlist:
```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Edit",
    "Bash(git commit:*)",
    "Bash(npm run:*)", 
    "Bash(git push:*)",
    "mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate"
  ]
}
```

#### MCP Integration
Create `.mcp.json` for team-wide tool availability:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    },
    "sentry": {
      "command": "mcp-sentry-server",
      "env": {
        "SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN": "${SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Proven Workflows

### 1. Enhanced Explore-Plan-Execute Pattern

#### Exploration Phase
```
# Context Gathering Protocol
1. "Read [specific files] and understand the current architecture. Don't write code yet."
2. "Use subagents to investigate [specific questions] about the codebase structure."
3. "Think hard about potential approaches and trade-offs."
```

#### Planning Phase  
We recommend using the word "think" to trigger extended thinking mode, which gives Claude additional computation time to evaluate alternatives more thoroughly

**Thinking Budget Levels:**
- `think` - Basic analysis (4,000 tokens)
- `think hard` - Moderate complexity
- `think harder` - Complex problems  
- `ultrathink` - Maximum thinking budget (31,999 tokens)

#### Execution Phase
```
# Implementation Protocol
1. "Implement your plan step by step."
2. "Verify each component as you build it."
3. "Run tests continuously during development."
4. "Update documentation as you go."
```

### 2. TDD-First Workflow (Recommended)

The robots LOVE TDD. Seriously. They eat it up. With TDD you have the robot friend build out the test, and the mock. Then your next prompt you build the mock to be real

```bash
# TDD Implementation Steps
1. "Write comprehensive tests for [feature] based on these requirements. Use TDD approach - avoid mock implementations."
2. "Run tests and confirm they fail appropriately."  
3. "Commit the tests with message: 'test: add tests for [feature]'"
4. "Implement code to make tests pass. Don't modify the tests."
5. "Iterate until all tests pass."
6. "Use independent subagents to verify implementation isn't overfitting to tests."
7. "Commit implementation with message: 'feat: implement [feature]'"
```

### 3. Visual-Driven Development
```bash
# Screenshot-Iterate Pattern
1. "Set up screenshot capability with Puppeteer MCP."
2. "Here's the design mock [attach image]."
3. "Implement the UI, take screenshots, and iterate until it matches."
4. "Focus on pixel-perfect implementation and responsive behavior."
```

### 4. Multi-Claude Parallel Workflows

Some of the most powerful applications involve running multiple Claude instances in parallel

#### Git Worktree Strategy
```bash
# Setup Multiple Workstreams  
git worktree add ../project-feature-a feature-a
git worktree add ../project-refactor-b refactor-b
git worktree add ../project-docs-c docs-update

# Launch Claude in each (separate terminals)
cd ../project-feature-a && claude
cd ../project-refactor-b && claude  
cd ../project-docs-c && claude
```

#### Code Review Workflow
```bash
# Writer Claude (Terminal 1)
"Implement the user authentication system following our security guidelines."

# Reviewer Claude (Terminal 2) 
"/clear"
"Review the authentication implementation in auth/ folder. Look for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and alignment with our patterns."

# Integration Claude (Terminal 3)
"/clear" 
"Read both the implementation and review feedback. Create final implementation addressing all concerns."
```
